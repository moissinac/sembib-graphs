This git repository is made to publish some graphs build in the SemBib project
(http://givingsense.eu/sembib/)

Graphs are saved with the graph store protocol

For example, the graph
http://givingsense.eu/sembib/onto/tpt/biblio

is saved with the request
http://!private access point!/sembib/get?graph=http://givingsense.eu/sembib/onto/tpt/biblio
